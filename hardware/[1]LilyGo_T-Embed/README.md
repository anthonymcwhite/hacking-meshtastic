## LilyGo T-Embed

<p>
  The LilyGo T-Embed is a versatile development board with a robust set of features available. Although *personally* I no longer use my t-embed as a Meshtastic Node, it absolutely supports the Meshtastic firmware and has everything needed and more to make for a spiffy little node. Because I utilize the
  t-embed for red teaming endeavors and testing, I will not unpack to much of the devices details in this repository. If you would like to see how I am using and hacking the LilyGo T-Embed, visit my other repo ---> [Dangerous Prototypes](https://github.com) <---
