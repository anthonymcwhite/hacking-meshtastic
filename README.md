### 2. Maps
<tt># When running a node(device) that does not have access to preloaded maps, maps must be manually saved onto a micro sd and transferred to the device they will be used on (ie Lilygo T-Deck)</tt></br>

<tt># For help installing maps on your device, consult the Meshtastic community page and if all else fails feel free to reach out to me. The maps available currently are ones that I have used and continue to use personally and will be updated over time.</tt></br>

<tt># **NOTE**- The maps *currently* hosted only offer a certain zoom level. For those from the U.S., the maps basically give a state level overview.</tt></br>
